# format is always `- character: "line in slide"`
# sometimes you want special characters, like title.. or sound... or action...
- title: A really stupid simple play
- ALICE: Only line in the slide.
# and other times, you have a character that speaks for a while, so you need multiple slides
- BOB:
    - Talks quite a bit.
    - But daaayyyyum.
# or multiple characters speak on the same slide
-
    - ALICE: Hey there. I'm Alice.
    - BOB: Hiya, I'm Bobby.
    - sound: dun dun dunnnnn
# or you need to have multiple lines on a single slide for a character
- ALICE:
    -
        - Did you just hear that?
        - That was really strange.
    - I'm certain I'm not hallucinating.
# and this is another way to specify multiple lines on a single slide
- BOB:
    - Hear what?
    - I'm <b>Deaf</b>.
# and you can see both of them in action with multiple characters, multiple lines, single slide
-
    - sound: audible gasps are heard
    - ALICE:
        - You?
        - You're Deaf?
    - BOB:
        - Yessirree.
        - Like Lady Gaga I was <i>born this way</i>.
# and if the character has a space in their name, you need to put double-quotes around them
-
    - LADY GAGA: Well you can bite me baby I was born this way
    - WEIRD AL: I may be covered with bees...
