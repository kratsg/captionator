===========

Uses Node because I should learn to use Node for a small project, like this.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started, I installed ``nvm``::

    brew install nvm

and then install Node and npm simultaneously::

    nvm install v5.5.0

In future logins, I can ``cd`` into the directory and run::

    nvm use v5.5.0

to get Node and npm in my environment.

Running
-------

Simply run::

    npm start

and we are good to go. We will probably incorporate ``forever.js`` in the near future.
